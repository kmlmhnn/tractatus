5.513 We might say that what is common to all symbols that affirm both p
and q is the proposition 'p . q'; and that what is common to all symbols
that affirm either p or q is the proposition 'p C q'. And similarly we can
say that two propositions are opposed to one another if they have nothing
in common with one another, and that every proposition has only one
negative, since there is only one proposition that lies completely outside
it. Thus in Russell's notation too it is manifest that 'q : p C Pp' says
the same thing as 'q', that 'p C Pq' says nothing.
