3.333 The reason why a function cannot be its own argument is that the sign
for a function already contains the prototype of its argument, and it
cannot contain itself. For let us suppose that the function F(fx) could be
its own argument: in that case there would be a proposition 'F(F(fx))', in
which the outer function F and the inner function F must have different
meanings, since the inner one has the form O(f(x)) and the outer one has
the form Y(O(fx)). Only the letter 'F' is common to the two functions, but
the letter by itself signifies nothing. This immediately becomes clear if
instead of 'F(Fu)' we write '(do) : F(Ou) . Ou = Fu'. That disposes of
Russell's paradox.
