4.241 When I use two signs with one and the same meaning, I express this by
putting the sign '=' between them. So 'a = b' means that the sign 'b' can
be substituted for the sign 'a'. (If I use an equation to introduce a new
sign 'b', laying down that it shall serve as a substitute for a sign a that
is already known, then, like Russell, I write the equation-- definition--in
the form 'a = b Def.' A definition is a rule dealing with signs.)
