5.156 It is in this way that probability is a generalization. It involves a
general description of a propositional form. We use probability only in
default of certainty--if our knowledge of a fact is not indeed complete,
but we do know something about its form. (A proposition may well be an
incomplete picture of a certain situation, but it is always a complete
picture of something .) A probability proposition is a sort of excerpt from
other propositions.
