4.1252 I call a series that is ordered by an internal relation a series of
forms. The order of the number-series is not governed by an external
relation but by an internal relation. The same is true of the series of
propositions 'aRb', '(d : c) : aRx . xRb', '(d x,y) : aRx . xRy . yRb', and
so forth. (If b stands in one of these relations to a, I call b a successor
of a.)
