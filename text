5.5261 A fully generalized proposition, like every other proposition, is
composite. (This is shown by the fact that in '(dx, O) . Ox' we have to
mention 'O' and 's' separately. They both, independently, stand in
signifying relations to the world, just as is the case in ungeneralized
propositions.) It is a mark of a composite symbol that it has something in
common with other symbols.
