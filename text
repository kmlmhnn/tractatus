5.46 If we introduced logical signs properly, then we should also have
introduced at the same time the sense of all combinations of them; i.e. not
only 'p C q' but 'P(p C q)' as well, etc. etc. We should also have
introduced at the same time the effect of all possible combinations of
brackets. And thus it would have been made clear that the real general
primitive signs are not ' p C q', '(dx) . fx', etc. but the most general
form of their combinations.
