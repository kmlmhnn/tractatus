6.1201 For example, the fact that the propositions 'p' and 'Pp' in the
combination '(p . Pp)' yield a tautology shows that they contradict one
another. The fact that the propositions 'p z q', 'p', and 'q', combined
with one another in the form '(p z q) . (p) :z: (q)', yield a tautology
shows that q follows from p and p z q. The fact that '(x) . fxx :z: fa' is
a tautology shows that fa follows from (x) . fx. Etc. etc.
