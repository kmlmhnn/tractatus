5.5262 The truth or falsity of every proposition does make some alteration
in the general construction of the world. And the range that the totality
of elementary propositions leaves open for its construction is exactly the
same as that which is delimited by entirely general propositions. (If an
elementary proposition is true, that means, at any rate, one more true
elementary proposition.)
