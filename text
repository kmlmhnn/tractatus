5.555 Clearly we have some concept of elementary propositions quite apart
from their particular logical forms. But when there is a system by which we

individual symbols. And anyway, is it really possible that in logic I
should have to deal with forms that I can invent? What I have to deal with
must be that which makes it possible for me to invent them.
