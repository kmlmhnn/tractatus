5.631 There is no such thing as the subject that thinks or entertains
ideas. If I wrote a book called The World as l found it , I should have to
include a report on my body, and should have to say which parts were
subordinate to my will, and which were not, etc., this being a method of
isolating the subject, or rather of showing that in an important sense
there is no subject; for it alone could not be mentioned in that book.--
