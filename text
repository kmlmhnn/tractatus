5.2521 If an operation is applied repeatedly to its own results, I speak of
successive applications of it. ('O'O'O'a' is the result of three successive
applications of the operation 'O'E' to 'a'.) In a similar sense I speak of
successive applications of more than one operation to a number of
propositions.
