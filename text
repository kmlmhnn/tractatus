5.541 At first sight it looks as if it were also possible for one
proposition to occur in another in a different way. Particularly with
certain forms of proposition in psychology, such as 'A believes that p is
the case' and A has the thought p', etc. For if these are considered
superficially, it looks as if the proposition p stood in some kind of
relation to an object A. (And in modern theory of knowledge (Russell,
Moore, etc.) these propositions have actually been construed in this way.)
