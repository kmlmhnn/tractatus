5.512 'Pp' is true if 'p' is false. Therefore, in the proposition 'Pp',
when it is true, 'p' is a false proposition. How then can the stroke 'P'
make it agree with reality? But in 'Pp' it is not 'P' that negates, it is
rather what is common to all the signs of this notation that negate p. That
is to say the common rule that governs the construction of 'Pp', 'PPPp',
'Pp C Pp', 'Pp . Pp', etc. etc. (ad inf.). And this common factor mirrors
negation.
