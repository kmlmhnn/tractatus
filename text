4.0411 If, for example, we wanted to express what we now write as '(x) .
fx' by putting an affix in front of 'fx'--for instance by writing 'Gen. fx'-
-it would not be adequate: we should not know what was being generalized.
If we wanted to signalize it with an affix 'g'--for instance by writing
'f(xg)'--that would not be adequate either: we should not know the scope of
the generality-sign. If we were to try to do it by introducing a mark into
the argument-places--for instance by writing '(G,G) . F(G,G)' --it would
not be adequate: we should not be able to establish the identity of the
variables. And so on. All these modes of signifying are inadequate because
they lack the necessary mathematical multiplicity.
