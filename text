5.42 It is self-evident that C, z, etc. are not relations in the sense in
which right and left etc. are relations. The interdefinability of Frege's
and Russell's 'primitive signs' of logic is enough to show that they are
not primitive signs, still less signs for relations. And it is obvious that
the 'z' defined by means of 'P' and 'C' is identical with the one that
figures with 'P' in the definition of 'C'; and that the second 'C' is
identical with the first one; and so on.
