4.1272 Thus the variable name 'x' is the proper sign for the pseudo-concept
object. Wherever the word 'object' ('thing', etc.) is correctly used, it is
expressed in conceptual notation by a variable name. For example, in the
proposition, 'There are 2 objects which. . .', it is expressed by ' (dx,y)
... '. Wherever it is used in a different way, that is as a proper concept-
word, nonsensical pseudo-propositions are the result. So one cannot say,
for example, 'There are objects', as one might say, 'There are books'. And
it is just as impossible to say, 'There are 100 objects', or, 'There are !0
objects'. And it is nonsensical to speak of the total number of objects.
The same applies to the words 'complex', 'fact', 'function', 'number', etc.
They all signify formal concepts, and are represented in conceptual
notation by variables, not by functions or classes (as Frege and Russell
believed). '1 is a number', 'There is only one zero', and all similar
expressions are nonsensical. (It is just as nonsensical to say, 'There is
only one 1', as it would be to say, '2 + 2 at 3 o'clock equals 4'.)
