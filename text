5.47 It is clear that whatever we can say in advance about the form of all
propositions, we must be able to say all at once . An elementary
proposition really contains all logical operations in itself. For 'fa' says
the same thing as '(dx) . fx . x = a' Wherever there is compositeness,
argument and function are present, and where these are present, we already
have all the logical constants. One could say that the sole logical
constant was what all propositions, by their very nature, had in common
with one another. But that is the general propositional form.
