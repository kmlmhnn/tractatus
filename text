4.46 Among the possible groups of truth-conditions there are two extreme
cases. In one of these cases the proposition is true for all the truth-
possibilities of the elementary propositions. We say that the truth-
conditions are tautological. In the second case the proposition is false
for all the truth-possibilities: the truth-conditions are contradictory .
In the first case we call the proposition a tautology; in the second, a
contradiction.
