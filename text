5.61 Logic pervades the world: the limits of the world are also its limits.
So we cannot say in logic, 'The world has this in it, and this, but not
that.' For that would appear to presuppose that we were excluding certain
possibilities, and this cannot be the case, since it would require that
logic should go beyond the limits of the world; for only in that way could
it view those limits from the other side as well. We cannot think what we
cannot think; so what we cannot think we cannot say either.
