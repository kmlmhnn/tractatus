4.12 Propositions can represent the whole of reality, but they cannot
represent what they must have in common with reality in order to be able
to represent it-- logical form. In order to be able to represent logical
form, we should have to be able to station ourselves with propositions
somewhere outside logic, that is to say outside the world.
