5.5301 It is self-evident that identity is not a relation between objects.
This becomes very clear if one considers, for example, the proposition '(x)
: fx . z . x = a'. What this proposition says is simply that only a
satisfies the function f, and not that only things that have a certain
relation to a satisfy the function, Of course, it might then be said that
only a did have this relation to a; but in order to express that, we should
need the identity-sign itself.
