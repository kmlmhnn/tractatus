6.1221 If, for example, two propositions 'p' and 'q' in the combination 'p
z q' yield a tautology, then it is clear that q follows from p. For
example, we see from the two propositions themselves that 'q' follows from
'p z q . p', but it is also possible to show it in this way: we combine
them to form 'p z q . p :z: q', and then show that this is a tautology.
