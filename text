4.1273 If we want to express in conceptual notation the general
proposition, 'b is a successor of a', then we require an expression for the
general term of the series of forms 'aRb', '(d : c) : aRx . xRb', '(d x,y)
: aRx . xRy . yRb', ... , In order to express the general term of a series
of forms, we must use a variable, because the concept 'term of that series
of forms' is a formal concept. (This is what Frege and Russell overlooked:
consequently the way in which they want to express general propositions
like the one above is incorrect; it contains a vicious circle.) We can
determine the general term of a series of forms by giving its first term
and the general form of the operation that produces the next term out of
the proposition that precedes it.
